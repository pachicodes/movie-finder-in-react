# Movie Finder
Movie Finder is a Web App that shows the user the Poster and Plot of a requested Movie. The user has to enter the movie name on the Input field, then click  in the SEARCH button.
Note that this repo code DOES NOT has the API Key, you can get yours at [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/hmerritt/api/imdb-internet-movie-database-unofficial/details) .

## Getting Started 
This webapp was created with ReactJS.
To get started, clone this repo and run npm start.


### How long did you spend on the challenge?
I spent around 4.5 hours on this challenge.

### What did you learn in this project?
I learned more about React. I first did it in VanillaJS which I am more comfortable with, and sonce that didn't take me long, I decided to change that into React for practice (Please let me know if you would like to see the Vanilla code as well).

### What do you like about your implementation?
My implementation is simple and straightforward, yet it is functional and a good display of my code and skills. 

### What you would change if you were going to do it again?
I would like to spend a little more time on the design, making it more user freindly.

### How did you make your design decisions?
I didn't want to spend much time on design, yet I wanted the app to look good, so I just looked at other projects I had done, choose a color theme that had to do with the topic (movie) and kept it minimalistic.

## Built With

* [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* [Movie Database, IMDB Alternative API](https://rapidapi.com/rapidapi/api/movie-database-imdb-alternative)


## Available Scripts
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
